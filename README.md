Creating a Human Resources (HR) management application using Flutter for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend API.
Backend (Spring Boot)
Employee API: RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on employees.
Authentication and Authorization: Implement JWT-based authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).
Database Integration: Use Spring Data JPA to interact with the database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Validation: Validate incoming requests to ensure data integrity.
Error Handling: Properly handle exceptions and errors.
Logging: Implement logging to track API usage and errors.
Security: Secure API endpoints and data transmission using HTTPS.
Testing: Write unit and integration tests for the API.
Database
